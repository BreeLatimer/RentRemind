# RentRemind

## Description
The main goal of this discord bot is to have a method of reminding my roommates that various bills are due.

## Usage
The bot is deployed to Heroku currently (this might be changing) so the bot currently runs on it's own. If you would like to learn how to edit the bot for your own usage you should read up on how deploying to Heroku works. Feel free to clone this repo and make your own edits!

## Improvements to be Made
* Dictionary for day:message so that the code is cleaner. 
* Commands for users to add new reminders (this would require a restructuring of the program).
* Allow the user to change what channel the messages are sent to
* Allow the user to change what roles get @'ed when the bot is ran

## Reflection
This was my first attempt at creating my own Discord bot and was also my first attempt at deploying to a hosting service. I was able to code up a bare-bones bot and get it deployed in about 3.5 hours. It is a good feeling to be able to look back on a small thing like this and say "wow, I did that!" This was probably the most fun I've had programming in a while so I plan on doing more small side projects like this in the future.
